There's something to be said about it, but that's not for here. Instead I'd rather talk about Burger Heaven and its 
wondrous habanero mango sauce. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaww yeah.

Also I just learned how to navigate around a UNIX Shell, how to work with Python, and now how to make things in Git. There 
are so many jokes that can be made about the name 'Git' but I'm saving them for another time.

Such as never.
